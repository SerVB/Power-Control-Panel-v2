# Power-Control-Panel-v2

Hello everyone! This is the long awaited version 2 of my power control panel. This is a WORK IN PROGRESS!

This software aims to add features wanted in the previous version while provided an updated modern user interface and featuring enhanced multithreading to provide the best user experience.

Features that are working:
-TDP changing for both AMD and Intel, including 12th gen alder lake
-TDP MSR changing for those intel devices that are problematic going above a certain TDP
-Volume and brightness (does not auto adjust, working on re-implementing that)
-Quick Access Menu
